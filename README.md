# VideoHR

This program detects heart rate from video files or live webcam video. To run, run liveVideo.py with python 3. Then, use W/A/S/D to resize and I/J/K/L to move the data collection box. For best results, make the box cover the largest possible area of consistently-colored, well-lit skin. Press space to begin analysis.

You can change the input video file and some other settings at the top of liveVideo.py.
